= Admin endpoint

As the name suggests, this endpoint is only for users with admin rights. Therefore to be able to make requests to the endpoint, you need to have a valid jwt token associated to an admin user.

The endpoint will throw 401 Unauthorized if a token is not provided with the request:
include::target/generated-snippets/Admin/Non-authenticated user trying to access resource/http-request.adoc[]
As you can see there is no Authorization header containing a bearer token, so the response is a 401 Unauthorized:
include::target/generated-snippets/Admin/Non-authenticated user trying to access resource/http-response.adoc[]

If the user is authenticated (having a valid bearer jwt token in the Authorization header) but not an admin:

Request:
include::target/generated-snippets/Admin/Non-admin user trying to create a vendor/http-request.adoc[]

Response:
include::target/generated-snippets/Admin/Non-admin user trying to create a vendor/http-response.adoc[]

Here is a response if the jwt token bearer is an admin:
